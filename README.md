# Programme and Scripting Final Project

## Background information about the data set

### Iris Dataset 
- https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris
  - Best known database to be found in pattern recognition literature
  - 3 classes of 50 instances each
  - Each class refers to a type of iris plant
  - One class is linearly separable for the other 2
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set
  - Quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species
  - Four features measured: length and width of sepals and petal, in centimetres
  - Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to the discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other
- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x
  - Published by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems as an example of linear discriminant analysis.
